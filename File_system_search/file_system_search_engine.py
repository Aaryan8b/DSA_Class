Problem:
"File System Search Engine"

Imagine you are building a search tool for a file system (like how Windows Search or find in Linux works).

You have:
A directory tree (folders can have subfolders and files).
Each file has a name.

Your task:
Search for a given file name in the directory tree.
Use recursion to traverse subfolders (DFS style).
Use iteration to keep track of files found and their full paths.
Optimize with a good algorithm so search is fast for large file systems (think pruning unnecessary branches).
